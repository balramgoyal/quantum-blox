## What is it

This is boilerplate for fully modular web UIs based on ReactJS + PostCSS with CSS Modules. Central piece is **Webpack**, which is connecting everything together, giving the technology that allows us to achieve full modularity and separation without any overhead. 

## Getting started with development

To start, clone the repo and

```
npm i 
```
## Dev build, watch and serve
To build dev code (unminified + sourcemaps)
```
npm run build: dev
```
To watch for changes and rebuild
```
npm run watch
```

## Hot module reload
work in progress...
## Production build
```
npm run build:Production
```
## Serving built data
To serve your App making it available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
```
npm run serve-static
```
## GH pages deployment
Work in progress
