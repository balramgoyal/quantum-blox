# Quantum blox - modular UI boilerplate in react

## What is it

This is boilerplate for fully modular web UIs based on ReactJS + PostCSS with CSS Modules. Central piece is **Webpack**, which is connecting everything together, giving the technology that allows us to achieve full modularity and separation without any overhead. 

## Getting started with development

To start, clone the repo and

```
npm i 

npm start
```

App is then available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**


**npm start runs webpack dev server with hot module replacement (HMR), which means that reloads after changes are fast and seamless**

## Technologies

* [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) 
* [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) (soon)
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss)
* [LostGrid](http://lostgrid.org/docs.html#getting-started)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 1 (soon to be migrated to Webpack 2 when I confirm that it covers this use case good enough)

## Modularity and separation
